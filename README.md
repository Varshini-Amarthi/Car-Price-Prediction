# Car-Price-Prediction
This project was created using machine learning to predict the car price with the actual price.
A machine learning model can be used to predict used car prices by considering a variety of factors.
The model can be trained on a dataset of historical car sales data, and it can then be used to predict the price of a car based on its features.
Then we need to use clustering methods and logistic regression methods and knn methods for predicting the output of car price. 
Also, we can use random forests and decision tree algorithms.
But i used DecisionTree algorithm.
Finally completed this project predicting the car prices with the actual prices.
